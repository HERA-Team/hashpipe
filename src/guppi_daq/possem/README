To install, run these *three* steps...

python setup.py build
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install

The two build steps are needed since the possem.py file is created during the
first build step only after its presence is needed.  It gets properly picked up
on the second build step.  Maybe someone will eventually fix this.
